# "Combinatorial Optimization with WL" book

This repository has chapters, code, and organizational materials for the book "Combinatorial Optimization with WL".

**The book is not finished yet -- it is a work in progress...**

## In brief

The goal of this book is to show how to apply several Combinatorial Optimization (CO) methods with Wolfram Language (WL).

The superior symbolic abilitties of WL together with WL's built-in optimization and visualization algorithms allow
the tackling of CO problems in advanced and interesting ways.

This book gives concrete directions how to apply certain CO techniques and communicate formulations and results.
